RoboViz360 is a Python-based ROS2 project that simulates and visualizes a robot navigating an environment with obstacles. It features a robot model with a LiDAR sensor, dynamic obstacle placement, and real-time visualization in RViz2. .The modular code allows easy extensions for movement control, sensing, and environment interaction.
